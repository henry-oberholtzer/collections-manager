## Technologies Used

- C#
- MySQL
- MSTest

## Description

## Refactor Goals

- Add tags to link items from collections (e.g. Sold, For Sale, Rare, Favorites, etc) (Many to Many)
- Add a page to view items within each tag
- Add data validation
- Date updated fields for collections
- Change EFCore methods to Async
- Selectable search category on main page
- Sort items by date added, or by value
- Add data validation for all inputs
- More layout / css
- When a user adds a collection, input fields create a new table with those properties in MySQL, create expandable categories for more specific things

    ```
    {
        "ConnectionStrings": {
            "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=collections_manager$> sudo apt-get install mysql-workbench-community$> sudo apt-get install mysql-workbench-community;uid=USERNAME;pwd=PASSWORD;"
        }
